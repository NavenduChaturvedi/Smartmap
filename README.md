# 🚀 RoadmapOS

> An RPG-style productivity and self-improvement dashboard built for ambitious people.

RoadmapOS transforms self-improvement into an immersive progression system — think RPG skill trees, XP gains, mission briefings, and achievement unlocks, but for real life goals.

Instead of boring task lists and guilt-powered productivity apps, RoadmapOS treats growth like a game:
- Build roadmaps for any life goal
- Complete missions and tasks
- Earn XP and level up
- Track streaks and consistency
- Unlock achievements
- Visualize long-term progress

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Most productivity apps fail because they feel like digital punishment.

RoadmapOS is designed to feel like:
- 🎮 An RPG progression system
- 🧠 A personal operating system
- 📊 A futuristic mission control dashboard
- ⚡ A dopamine-friendly growth tracker

> *"progression over perfection"*

## 🚧 Current Status

```
Frontend MVP:     ████████████████████░░░  82% Complete
Backend:          ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  Planning Phase
Overall:          ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░  ~50% Complete
```

**Frontend MVP is stable and fully interactive.** All core pages are built, wired, and stateful. Backend integration is the next major phase.

## ✅ What's Built

### Core Pages
- `index.html` — Entry page (repaired and stable)
- `dashboard.html` — Fully interactive: task toggles, XP tracking, pending count, live status updates
- `roadmap.html` — Interactive node system with dynamic mission briefing panel
- `analytics.html` — Connected to persisted app state (XP, streak, task metrics)
- `achievements.html` — Filters (All/Rare/Common/Locked), modals, commander/vault summary from state
- `settings.html` — Full persistence: theme, font scale, profile fields, scanlines/sound/animation toggles

### Architecture
- **Shared state layer** — `aegis_state_v1` via localStorage; consistent data across all pages
- **Web Components** — `<aegis-sidebar>` and `<aegis-topbar>` replace hundreds of lines of repeated HTML
- **Centralized JS** — All scripts extracted to `js/` directory (no inline scripts)
- **Global CSS** — `css/base.css` and `js/tailwind-config.js` replace scattered inline styles
- **Zero broken links** — All navigation wired and functional
- **Lint-clean** — All edited files verified

### Roadmap Features
- Clickable nodes update mission title, description, rewards, and sub-task checklist dynamically
- Selected node persists across page reloads
- Visual highlight for active selected node

---

## 🔄 In Progress

- Backend provider selection (Firebase vs Supabase)
- Auth flow design (sign up, login, session restore)
- Remote persistence model to replace localStorage

---

## 🗺️ Next Steps

1. **Choose backend** — Firebase or Supabase; define data model for users, roadmaps, tasks
2. **Implement auth** — Sign up, login, session restore; replace localStorage with remote persistence
3. **Sync strategy** — Offline cache + conflict resolution for roadmap progress
4. **Re-introduce signup flow** — After backend is stable
5. **YouTube Course Player** — Paste a course link, watch inside the app, auto-track lecture progress

Each roadmap supports:
- Stages, milestones, tasks, subtasks
- Progress tracking and completion %
- Interactive node-based visual tree

### 🎮 Gamification
- **XP** — Earned from tasks, milestones, streaks, roadmap completions
- **Leveling** — Progress through XP milestones
- **Achievements** — Unlock badges for consistency, speed, streaks, completions

### 📊 Analytics

## 🎨 Design

**Color Palette**

| Color | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Pearl White | Primary text / highlights |
| Charcoal Stone | Main background |
| Graphite Gray | Secondary surfaces |
| Soft Silver | UI accents |
| Muted Black | Depth / shadows |

**UI Philosophy** — Futuristic, immersive, minimal, smooth, rewarding. Not a corporate admin panel.
